# Top Dockerhub images scan
A python script to scan top Dockerhub images for dependancy vulnerabilities and compile a summary table. **Cloudguard Shiftleft** is used to perform the scan.

The Check Point CloudGuard platform provides cloud native security, with advanced threat prevention for all assets and workloads – in public, private, hybrid or multi-cloud environment – providing unified security to automate security everywhere. As part of the CloudGuard family, Check Point shiftleft brings CloudGuards security abilities to detect and prevent risk in cloud deployments into the CI/CD pipeline. shiftleft provides a single interface for multiple CI/CD security steps, including scanning your Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates for risk, checking your software for known vulnerabilities, and scanning container images for security issues.
