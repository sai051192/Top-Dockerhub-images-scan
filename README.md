# Top-Dockerhub-images-scan
A python script to scan top Dockerhub images for dependancy vulnerabilities and compile a summary table. Cloudguard Shiftleft is used to perform the scan.

ShiftLeft approach refers to moving security sooner in the development process. In the graph of the process of application development, with time as the X axis, security is often a final step, prior to deployment. To assess and scan your code at the earlier stages of development, you can use Check Point ShiftLeft that brings CloudGuard security abilities to detect and prevent risk in cloud deployments into the CI/CD pipeline. ShiftLeft provides a single interface for various CI/CD security steps.

ShiftLeft capabilities:

Scans your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) for risks

Checks your software for known vulnerabilities

Scans container images (Kubernetes containers) for security issues
